# HACK STASH

Hack Stash is a virtual file system. Use Hack Stash to challenge your friends to submit coding challenges.
Hack Stash makes it easy to create different coding challenges and allow users to upload files with their solution.
You can resubmit your files and wait for the challenge creator to grade your solution.

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Handlebars
* HTML & CSS
* Ajax & JSON
* Mongoose

## Biggest Learning Moments

Hack Stash was created as a group project. This allowed us to internalize the workflow of Git and Github. As a group we supported each other and and were able to move quicker.

1. Virtual attributes in Moongoose that queries a different Schema are going to fail because they are return asynchronous
2. When using Handlebars to generate html one needs to manipulating the data when it comes back directly before it goes to handlebars.

## Ideas For Future Iterations

As the next step we would love to integrate another third party API that could allow users of Hack Stash to automatically get the submission files graded.
