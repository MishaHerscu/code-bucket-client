# HACK STASH

Hack Stash is a virtual file system. Use Hack Stash to challenge your friends to submit coding challenges.
Hack Stash makes it easy to create different coding challenges and allow users to upload files with their solution.
You can resubmit your files and wait for the challenge creator to grade your solution.

## Challenges biggest learning moments

Hack Stash was created as a group project. This allowed us to internalize the workflow of Git and Github. As a group we supported each other and and were able to move quicker.
